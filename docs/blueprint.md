## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3399FF). Its brightness makes it versatile for both light and dark themes, and the choice is influenced by the theme of clear skies and open-ended intelligence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for light theme, dark gray (#333333) for dark theme. These hues, lightly desaturated from the primary, make the primary 'pop' for CTAs, but allow content to be central. The two background colors serve as theme toggle.
- Accent color: Blue-violet (#8A2BE2). Slightly more saturated than the primary, for visual interest. It's also a complementary color that creates emphasis for secondary interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Clean, modern and works well for both headlines and body, providing great readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', monospace. Useful in displaying computer code where necessary.
- Use clean, modern icons from a library like FontAwesome or Remix Icon. Icons should complement the text labels and enhance usability.
- Use a modular layout with Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox. Follow a mobile-first approach for responsiveness, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) on content load and user interactions to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
